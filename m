Sometimes I think "Linux is so full of crap, it hardly matters if more
crap is added".  Other times I feel a bit more social responsibility and
want to fight against adding too much more crap.

Fragmentation.
This is exactly the platform problem.  People look at the existing
functionality, decide that it doesn't quite meet their needs, and then
do an implement something that is mostly the same but just different
enough so that they feel more comfortable.

We have 'seq_file' which encourages people to create line-oriented info
files, but if some have tab-separate lines, others have CSV, others have
yaml etc, then there is plenty of room for confusion.

If we could, instead, just agreed that more structured data actually can
make sense in sysfs, and come up with a coherent approach that we can
all tolerate, then life would be much easier.

IIRC the nfsd filesystem was added to address the difficulty of
supporting a systemcall in a module.  That basically doesn't work, so
there needed to be some clean interface between some minimal nfsdctl system=
call
code that was always compiled in, and the actually implementation that
could be in a module.  It was Viro who particularly noticed this need,
so it was a filesystem that was chosen to fill the need - filesystems in
modules was already a solved problem.
The system call was (I think) write-only (no non-trivial return data)
and each file just recieved a binary struct that matches the syscall
argument.
Once that was in place, it became a dumping ground for whatever we
wanted.

sysfs was, I think, originally about power management.  It exposed
connections between devices more than the devices themselves.  This
allowed user-space to be able to power-things down when not in use, and
to understand the dependencies.
Since then it grew....

Depends on what you mean by that.  Original files where write-only and
where slightly complex attributes. Writing performed an action, like
adding an entry to the export table (first you add a client, then add a
client+filesystem to export it).

This idea for a file performing an action, rather than presenting an
attribute, is much the same as the "bind" and "unbind" files you can
find in sysfs.

(see also https://lwn.net/Articles/378884/ for examples of sysfs files
that are not one-attribute-per-file)

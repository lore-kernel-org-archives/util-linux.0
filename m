Hello Johannes,

Thank you for feedback. I removed the rfkill command strings from
translations, and gave hint to translators how to deal with them in
usage() output. Also in same go updates are rebased on top of
most recent upstream to get usage() --help and --version handling
done correctly.

What comes  to maintenance I am fairly optimistic util-linux is a
good home for the rfkill. Karel, what do you think?

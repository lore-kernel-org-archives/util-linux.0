It can have as much as 4 superblock backup copies:

Superblock offset 0 is 65536 (0x10000, block=16/0x10)
Superblock offset 1 is 67108864 (0x4000000, block=16384/0x4000)
Superblock offset 2 is 274877906944 (0x4000000000, block=67108864/0x4000000)
Superblock offset 3 is 1125899906842624 (0x4000000000000, block=274877906944/0x4000000000)
Superblock offset 4 is 4611686018427387904 (0x4000000000000000, block=1125899906842624/0x4000000000000)

And for that purpose all the superblock copies should be taken into
account, regardless of the tricks that btrfs_mount applies.

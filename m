As I understood, issue exists only at x86 platform, where 
MC146818-compatible RTC used.

But even if you will correctly detect platform, there is no guaranty to 
get exactly MC146818 RTC. RTC can be other type. It even can be not 
single in the system.

What is more or less usable is "/sys/class/rtc/rtcX/name" file, which 
contains driver name.
For x86 and MC146818-compatible RTC its name is "rtc_cmos". And it can 
be used to distinguish RTC type by hwclock utility.

Best wishes.

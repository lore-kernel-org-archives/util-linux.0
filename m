I went through the patches and the code all looks fine to me. The only
real questions I think are what sort of info we want to present here,
and how we'll deal with changes to the format in the future.

Maybe on that latter point, we can reserve the right to add fields to
this info later, but do our best to never remove existing ones? Then
tools could be written to just ignore the fields that they don't
understand.

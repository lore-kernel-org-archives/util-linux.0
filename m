    Sure give better control, but not as widely known as "df" or "mount".

I might point out that by default,

It's not a device in /dev/ nor is it in /proc/devices.

Conversely, 

klogd 1.4.1, log source = ksyslog started.

The kernel seems to know the root image at boot (even told twice from
this output!)

Not to mention, there is some comment in the kernel-related code of using
/dev/root because there is no writable storage available... even though
the command line
shows that root is mounted 'rw'...

I'm not talking about custom file formats, better just add a mount -c,
and do mount -c /etc/kernelfs.d/*.conf, or whatever will fit systemv
needs.

This is nothing really to share between systemd and systemv here. This
problem just does not exist for systemd.

And for systemv it should not be solved in mount(8), but in a systemv
specific part.

A change in common tools at that level breaks much more than it solves.

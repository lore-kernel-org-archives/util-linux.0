Oh.  I should add that I am always parsing the LSM mount options out so
that there is not a chance of the individual filesystems implementing
comflicting options even when there are no LSMs active.  Without that I
am afraid we run the risk of having LSM mount otions in conflict with
ordinary filesystems options at some point and by the time we discover
it it would start introducing filesystem regressions.

That does help with stack though as there is no fundamental reason only
one LSM could process mount options.

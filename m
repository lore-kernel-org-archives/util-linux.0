 Hmm... why inconsistent (or missing) superblock is not reported as a
 problem? If I good understand the filesystem is still mountable,
 right?

 Well, this is exactly the idea behind wipefs(8), just wipe minimal
 number of bytes from the device to make the filesystem invisible for
 libblkid (udev, ...). This concept is relatively safe, if you make a
 mistake than you can restore the magic string, your data should not
 be affected by wipefs(8).

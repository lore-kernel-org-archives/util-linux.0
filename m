Hello everyone,

It seems Andreas is a Debian Developer (like myself), so I used the
debian tooling for 'missing in action' (mia-query) and it seems
he is occationally active (but showing obvious signs of busyness).

I even found his irc nick and found him online. I told him about this
mailing list thread and he replied that he has been extremely busy
with things in his personal life lately and said he should really
try to find some time to catch up with things, but since he hasn't
replied here I thought I'd just let you know about the situation.
Hopefully things calms down for him soon to allow him to catch up.

I hope you find a good way to handle things in the mean time. More
people probably need to help out reviewing incoming issues/PRs and other
things that can help Andreas out with the maintenance burden, but with
his current lack of time it might be better if someone motivated and
capable just forks the project on github and starts doing the
maintenance work in the fork. If things works out well, maybe this gives
Andreas confidence he can safely hand over the official maintainer role
to someone with more time for it (and you can 'unfork' again).

Regards,
Andreas Henriksson

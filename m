I like that idea.  Maybe <fsname.txt> will need a defined format, though,
right?  Maybe asciidoc?

I've still been meaning (in theory) to produce a mount manpage just for xfs.
I'm still willing to do that if the above doesn't pan out.  I just need
to get to it.  I'd be happy to do it for extN as well.

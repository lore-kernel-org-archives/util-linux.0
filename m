I guess that number of zram devices will be always relatively small
compare to /dev/loopN devices. It is not unusual that people use
systems with more than 256 loop devs, so /dev/loop-control makes a lot
of sense to keep the device management effective and simple.

If you have really many loopN devices than create all the nodes at
boot time means extra overhead (allocate nodes in kernel, events to
udev, create /dev files etc.).  The ioctl LOOP_CTL_* API also provides
LOOP_CTL_GET_FREE that returns unused device, so you don't have to
scan all the /dev/loopN devices to detect a free device.

Again, I don't think it's so important for zram as for loop devices.
All depends how people will use zram devices. We will see...

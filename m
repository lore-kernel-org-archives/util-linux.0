Hi Dan, Karel, and others,

I did not run 'make checksmatch', but added following variables and did 
usual ./configure && make

export CC=/src/smatch/cgcc
export PATH="/src/smatch:$PATH"
export CFLAGS="-Wsparse-all"

With these right now upstream gives errors such as this:

text-utils/more.c:674:43: error: symbol 'end_it' redeclared with different 
type (originally declared at text-utils/more.c:143) - different modifiers

that are caused by lack of function attributes in declaration, while 
fuction has them. An attempt to fix the declarations caused made me to get 
noise about attributes vs declaration order. Such versions of files never 
entered to util-linux, and that is the reason why you do not see these.

See below simple source file that demonstrates how to triggers warning in 
question. When I said was 'smatch' printed warnings it was cgcc that was 
complaining , and therefore this is not really a 'smatch' problem at all. 
Sorry about giving wrong impression.

When comparing gcc with clang gives very similar warning. Perhaps the 
right way to go about this is to reorder attributes to be in front of 
functions after all.

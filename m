As a general comment, I would like to use fstab.d for replacing
the initscripts which mount kernel filesystems in Debian initscripts
(sysvinit).  We currently hardcode the logic to mount each filesystem
and additionally hardcode the defaults, and permit the defaults to
be overridden by the user via /etc/default/* or via entries in
/etc/fstab.  This could be done much more straightforwardly using
entries such as /etc/fstab.d/kernfs and /etc/fstab.d/tmpfs etc.

package manager's conffile handling, meaning it's much simpler
for the user to customise.

approach, we could then share the configuration between the different
init systems.

Note that I've not actually taken any of these steps yet; I'm
about to test it with the upcoming util-linux release and the
current prerelease, but it is something under consideration.

I definitely *do* see the restrictions sysfs as being a problem, and I'd
guess NFS developers thought the same, since the "one value per file"
paradigm means that any kind of complex data needs to be split over
hundreds or thousands of files, which is very inefficient for userspace =
to
use.  Consider if /proc/slabinfo had to follow the sysfs paradigm, this =
would
(on my system) need about 225 directories (one per slab) and 3589 =
separate
files in total (one per value) that would need to be read every second =
to
implement "slabtop".  Running strace on "top" shows it taking 0.25s wall =
time
to open and read the files for only 350 processes on my system, at 2 =
files
per process ("stat" and "statm"), and those have 44 and 7 values, =
respectively,
so if it had to follow the sysfs paradigm would make this far worse.

I think it would make a lot more sense to have one file per item of =
interest,
and make it e.g. a well-structured YAML format ("name: value", with =
indentation
denoting a hierarchy/grouping of related items) so that it can be both =
human
and machine readable, easily parsed by scripts using bash or awk, rather =
than
having an explicit directory+file hierarchy.  Files like /proc/meminfo =
and
/proc/<pid>/status are already YAML-formatted (or almost so), so it =
isn't ugly
like XML encoding.

Sure, except that is a catch-22.  We can't discuss what is needed until
the code is in the kernel, but we can't get it into the kernel until the
files it puts in /proc have been moved into /sys?

Cheers, Andreas

cgcc is just a shell script which calls either smatch or sparse.  Smatch
uses sparse as a parser so you sometimes do see certain sparse messages
when you run smatch, but I don't do bug fixes for those normally.  You
would think I would understand sparse really well because I use it so
much but actually hacking sparse makes me realize I'm kind of dumb.  ;P

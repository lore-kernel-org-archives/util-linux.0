*Blink*  I had missed the cifs issue.  So yes we certainly need
a better way to encode things in the buffer.  I just used a single
string as an easy way to place everything in a buffer.

I don't totally disagree with this.  But I will point out that
except for coda passing a file descriptor there are no filesystems
that currently take or need binary options.

I suspect that as long as userspace supports /etc/fstab and we in turn
support /proc/mounts there is going to be a lot of pressure to keep
the majority of options so they  can be encoded in a string separated by
commas.

There are also mount options that depend on each other and whose order
matters with respect to other mount options extN's ("sb=<NNNN>") for
example.

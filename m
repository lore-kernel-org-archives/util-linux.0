Hello,

my quick thoughts on the topic. first, I'm not against, and we might have
something like this one day, but...

well, run-time data loss, assuming that fs has failed to read a page,
because e.g. zram has mistakenly discarded it, I believe, is out of this
topic. any other type of data loss is out of zram design. whenever user
decides to umount/reboot/etc., it's his/her sole responsibility to keep
the data, zram is not meant to help here.

uninitialised or reset (when unneeded) device *must* be almost free:
there are no zspool, fs, compression backend, etc. which means that
one can pre-allocated as many devices as he needs and init/reset devices
whenever required.

so the problem seems to be "we can do A, but it doesn't look very
convenient", rather than "we can't do A".

 I'd like to add support for /etc/fstab.d to libmount. The library is
 currently used by mount, umount and mount.nfs. The goal is to use it
 on more places.

 The /etc/fstab.d directory has been requested by people who maintains
 large number of mountpoints etc.

 The directory is not replacement for /etc/fstab, it's additional place
 where you can describe your filesystems.

 The disadvantage is that the stuff in the directory will be invisible
 for some tools (udisks, systemd, ...), so I have very vocal
 disagreement from some people who don't want to see /etc/fstab.d at all.

 BTW, systemd allows to define addition mountpoints in
 systemd.mount(5) unit file(s), so we already have additional place
 for fstab stuff...

 Commands? Objections?

    Karel

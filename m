It is just very wrong to expose kernel filesystems to system mounts.
Please invent your own config if you want that for packaging. The
kernel filesystems do not belong in fstab, and for the same reason not
in fstab.d/.

The init systems need to handle the mounts, but unlikely by sharing
additional config files. For systemd it is a solved problem, we don't
need fstab.d/ for that, and sysv should not start to try to solve it
at that level, because it will conflict with systemd.

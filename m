Normally, dynamic management is good to have, I think but I didn't hear
strong requirement for that until now.
Why don't you change num_device param at module loading time?
I'd like to hear real scenario from whom are about to using that faeture
right now and what's the problem with num_device param.

If there is any holder of device, we shouldn't destroy the device.
It's doable.

I vote such standard tool to control each zram device's property but need
more thinking about dynamic device adding/removal.

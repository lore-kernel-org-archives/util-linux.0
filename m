To be fair, these can be split into two categories: kernel filesystems
such as procfs, sysfs etc., and special-purpose tmpfs mounts.  The
former could be kept in the init scripts, but the latter are commonly
required to be customised (or disabled) by admins, and the fstab format
is the natural way to express this.  This would include tmpfs mounts
for e.g. /run, /run/lock, /run/shm, potentially /tmp] and others, each
of which has separate limits.

Inventing custom file formats for these (as is the current situation)
is both opaque to the admin and less amenable to preservation/upgrading
of the admins customisations and the defaults.

Roger

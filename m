Hi all,

Good to hear, and I am glad coding time was not wasted propose the
dynamic zram devices in form of patches.  And as it was said before who
knows how the user kind will end up using these devices, which may mean
in future reconsideration, but for now number of devices will only
follow module load time instruction.

I think the reasonable thing to do is to adjust documentation a little
bit.  Users should load number of devices they  need plus few spares to
avoid getting corner by inability to foresee future device needs.

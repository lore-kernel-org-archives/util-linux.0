As David has pointed out with cifs having a sep= option we need a better
story of parsing the options in the kernel.

What my branch does is demonstrate there is at least one way we can
avoid mount options being silently different from what userspace
expects.

Which means my branch is fine for looking at semantics and possible
system calls, but not much else.

I actually used multiple system calls just so I could avoid dealing
with multi-plexor systems calls.

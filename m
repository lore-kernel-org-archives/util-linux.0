Subject: [PATCH 00/10] exposing knfsd opens to userspace
Date:   Thu, 25 Apr 2019 10:04:10 -0400

From: "J. Bruce Fields" <bfields@redhat.com>

The following patches expose information about NFSv4 opens held by knfsd
on behalf of NFSv4 clients.  Those are currently invisible to userspace,
unlike locks (/proc/locks) and local proccesses' opens (/proc/<pid>/).

The approach is to add a new directory /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/ with
subdirectories for each active NFSv4 client.  Each subdirectory has an
"info" file with some basic information to help identify the client and
an "opens" directory that lists the opens held by that client.

I got it working by cobbling together some poorly-understood code I
found in libfs, rpc_pipefs and elsewhere.  If anyone wants to wade in
and tell me what I've got wrong, they're more than welcome, but at this
stage I'm more curious for feedback on the interface.

I'm also cc'ing people responsible for lsof and util-linux in case they
have any opinions.

Currently these pseudofiles look like:

  # find /proc/fs/nfsd/clients -type f|xargs tail 
  ==> /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/3741/opens <==
  5cc0cd36/6debfb50/00000001/00000001	rw	--	fd:10:13649	'open id:\x00\x00\x00&\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x0b\xb7\x89%\xfc\xef'
  5cc0cd36/6debfb50/00000003/00000001	r-	--	fd:10:13650	'open id:\x00\x00\x00&\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x0b\xb7\x89%\xfc\xef'

Each line of the "opens" file is tab-delimited and describes one open,
and the fields are stateid, open access bits, deny bits,
major:minor:ino, and open owner.

So, some random questions:

	- I just copied the major:minor:ino thing from /proc/locks, I
	  suspect we would have picked something different to identify
	  inodes if /proc/locks were done now.  (Mount id and inode?
	  Something else?)

	- The open owner is just an opaque blob of binary data, but
	  clients may choose to include some useful asci-encoded
	  information, so I'm formatting them as strings with non-ascii
	  stuff escaped.  For example, pynfs usually uses the name of
	  the test as the open owner.  But as you see above, the ascii
	  content of the Linux client's open owners is less useful.
	  Also, there's no way I know of to map them back to a file
	  description or process or anything else useful on the client,
	  so perhaps they're of limited interest.

	- I'm not sure about the stateid either.  I did think it might
	  be useful just as a unique identifier for each line.
	  (Actually for that it'd be enough to take just the third of
	  those four numbers making up the stateid--maybe that would be
	  better.)

In the "info" file, the "name" line is the client identifier/client
owner provided by the client, which (like the stateowner) is just opaque
binary data, though as you can see here the Linux client is providing a
readable ascii string.

There's probably a lot more we could add to that info file eventually.

Other stuff to add next:

	- nfsd/clients/#/kill that you can write to to revoke all a
	  client's state if it's wedged somehow.
	- lists of locks and delegations; lower priority since most of
	  that information is already in /proc/locks.

--b.

  nfsd: persist nfsd filesystem across mounts
  nfsd: rename cl_refcount
  nfsd4: use reference count to free client
  nfsd: add nfsd/clients directory
  nfsd: make client/ directory names small ints
  rpc: replace rpc_filelist by tree_descr
  nfsd4: add a client info file
  nfsd4: add file to display list of client's opens
  nfsd: expose some more information about NFSv4 opens
  nfsd: add more information to client info file

 Thanks, but I'm not sure this is the right way. It would be better to
 create BTRFS specific btrfs.5 man page and maintain it together with
 another BTRFS stuff rather then within util-linux. In the mount.8
 should be only a note about btrfs.5.

 My long time goal is to remove all FS specific sections (at least for
 mainstream filesystems) from mount.8, because we duplicate effort
 here. The primary and well maintained is usually kernel
 Documentation/filesystems/ and unfortunately FS developers don't care
 about mount.8 at all.

 The ideal solution would be to generate the FS man pages from kernel
 docs (for example from asciidoc etc.)

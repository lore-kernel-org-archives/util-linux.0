I like that!  I really do.  It returns the same error as mount would if
run by a privileged uses, or returns success without actually changing
anything.
MS_NOMOUNT is incompatible with MS_REMOUNT, MS_MOVE and several others.

I won't be providing a kernel patch straight away, but I would like to
see this happen.

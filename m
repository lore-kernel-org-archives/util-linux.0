/proc/fs/nfsd is the (standard) mount point for a separate NFSD-specific
filesystem, originally created to replace the nfsd-specific
systemcall.
So the nfsd developers have a fair degree of latitude as to what can go
in there.

But I *don't* think it is a good idea to follow this pattern.  Creating
a separate control filesystem for every different module that thinks it
has different needs doesn't scale well.  We could end up with dozens of
tiny filesystems that all need to be mounted at just the right place.  I
don't think that is healthy for Linus.

Nor do I think we should be stuffing stuff into debugfs that isn't
really for debugging.  That isn't healthy either.

If sysfs doesn't meet our needs, then we need to raise that in
appropriate fora and present a clear case and try to build consensus -
because if we see a problem, then it is likely that others do to.

This is all presumably in the context of Lustre and while lustre is
out-of-tree we don't have a lot of leverage.  So I wouldn't consider
pursuing anything here until we get back upstream.

--security-erase is the nearest thing to a "low level format" that exists.
On some mechanical drives, it actually performs a true low level format.

For SSDs, most manufacturers that I have dealt with use --security-erase
as their preferred method for reinitializing a corrupted drive.

--security-erase is normally much faster than TRIM as well.

Hi Sergey, and the others,

I expected this to be the case.

Thank you for explanation, I understand.  But as Karel mentioned in the
previous message the zramctl will be kept simple, at least for now, which
means support to change number of streams in cases when device is multi
streaming capable will not be present.  At least for now.

Secondly the few updates to zramctl I wrote couple days ago are now ready
for final review.  Most importantly the last one of the changes is
modified to be a message change.  It was earlier the patch 8/8 in first
message of this thread, that allowed algorithm and streams changes
without reset.  Now it this modest improvement.

And here are there reset.

Reading your earlier message it is now clear to me the there never was
a bug, but just lack of understanding how the zram is meant to work.

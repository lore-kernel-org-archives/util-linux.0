All drives I have are flash drives so none of them reports 4k physical
sectors. But it does seems possible in the case I linked. The thing is
these VPDs/transfer lengths are probably provided by the USB to
ATA(/SCSI?) bridges. I can't judge if they are wrong to set the
lengths that way but it seem to be a common practice. I have two USB
devices provide the SBC-2 (Block limit VPD), one is a SanDisk Extreme
USB (SDCZ80), another an Intel X25-M Gen1 on an ASMedia SATA adapter,
and both of them set the Optimal transfer length. The usb-storage
driver does not read vpd so it won't be a thing, but the the uas
driver does.

I just feel like the kernel shouldn't bind values from totally
different source (raid stripe vs vpd limit) to the same variable. I
don't know if what else would make use of this variable but by only
considering the fdisk case, it seems the scsi disk driver should be
the one who should stop binding.

This is simply too idealistic especially when it seems that this issue
mostly happens on USB bridges. I am not even sure if the SCSI
standards has anything to say about this practice.

Yeah that's why I said fdisk should allow custom alignment.

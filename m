In the design yes, and I allow setting them.  It appears in the code
to retrieve the mount options I forgot to call security_sb_show_options.

For finding the super block that you are going to mount the LSM mount
options are not relevant.  Even nfs will not want to set those early as
they do not help determine the nfs super block.  So the only place where
there is anything interesting in my api is in reading back the security
options so they can be compared to the options the mounter is setting.

I will add the missing call to security_sb_show_options which is enough
to fix selinux.  Unfortunately smack does not currently implement
.sb_show_options.  Not implementing smack_sb_show_options means
/proc/mounts fails to match /etc/mtab which is a bug and it is likely
a real workd bug for the people who use smack and don't want to depend
on /etc/mtab, or are transitioning away from it.

Casey do you want to implement smack_sb_show_options or should I put it
on my todo list?

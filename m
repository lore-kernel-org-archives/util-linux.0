Hello,

I did couple last minute changes to my remote branch, that should now be
ready for final review.

git://github.com/kerolasa/lelux-utiliteetit.git rfkill

The changes:

1. Add commit to make rfkill_event struct read size check to be back and
   forward compatible.
   https://github.com/kerolasa/lelux-utiliteetit/commit/fdb76db0d32fdd77bff49b6c2a7db77763b1c4e4

2. Refer this email thread in merge commit.
   https://github.com/kerolasa/lelux-utiliteetit/commit/0b6c2693debf1219cfbe39dcf70e208abc94c1af

3. Change 'yes' and 'no' in rfkill status output to 'blocked' and
   'unblocked' that are more associative with command strings. Here is a
   sample output:

   $ rfkill
   DEVICE            ID TYPE      SOFT      HARD
   ideapad_wlan      0  wlan      unblocked unblocked
   ideapad_bluetooth 1  bluetooth blocked   unblocked
   hci0              2  bluetooth blocked   unblocked
   phy0              3  wlan      unblocked unblocked

4. Mark in configure.ac rfkill is linux only utility.
   https://github.com/kerolasa/lelux-utiliteetit/commit/5f715abb96a4fa3699bcfdb35d029d7ae3a5ea07#diff-67e997bcfdac55191033d57a16d1408aR1596

5. Small wording change in --output manual page entry: s/list of all
   supported/list of available/. The later matches with --help output
   title, hopefully makes it easier to know what is being referred.

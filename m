  I don't mind the discrepancy between /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts that much
(/proc/mounts is a fine replacement of /etc/mtab for me) but I agree that
handling of mount options on remount is a mess and IMHO it's made even
worse by mount(8) adding options from /etc/mtab to mount(2) syscall when
-o remount is specified. But realistically I can hardly imagine how to fix
all this mess because I'd almost bet userspace depends on the behavior.

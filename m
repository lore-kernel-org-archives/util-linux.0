I think that's putting the problem a little too strongly.  The
glibc API is generic: it can (and is) used to parse any file using
the fstab(5) file format; it's not restricted to only /etc/mtab
and /etc/fstab.  setmntent(3) accepts any filename.

You are entirely correct that it may break the assumptions made by
some software, but it's certainly not "ABI" or even "API" breakage.

The number of tools which do this is tiny, and could (if we wished)
be patched trivially to also look at the files in fstab.d.

Alternatively, glibc itself could be updated so that if e.g.
setmntent(3) is called with "/etc/fstab" as its filename argument,
it will additionally process and include the contents of
/etc/fstab.d as well.  This would have the advantage of transparency
for all users of the glibc interface.

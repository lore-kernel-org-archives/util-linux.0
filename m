So what are your pain points?  What data do you really want to present in
a structured file?
Look at /proc/self/mountstats on some machine which has an NFS mount.
There would be no problem adding similar information for lustre mounts.

What data do you want to export to user-space, which wouldn't fit there
and doesn't fit the one-value-per-file model.  To make a case, we need
concrete data.

Or maybe just removed.  If lustre is usable without some of these files,
then we can land lustre without them, and then start the conversation
about how to export the data that we want exported.

 The kernel is the "ideal place", but it's more dream than anything
 else... what we use for example for NFS is to maintain FS specific
 man page in userspace FS package (e.g. nfs-utils).

 Wouldn't be possible to add the man page to btrfs-progs package? The
 package is maintained by btrfs guys and I guess all btrfs users have
 very probably installed the package.

 I personally have no problem to maintain information about arbitrary
 FS in mount.8, the problem are updates. Unfortunately, kernel FS developers
 don't care about the man page at all and it's very often not up to date.

 [My experience is very bad. Not sure why, but for many kernel devels
  commit into Linus' tree is end of their work, they don't care if there
  is usable userpsace util or docs for users, people like Eric Biederman
  or Lukas Czerner are rare exception.]

 OK, we can try it, if you still prefer mount.8.

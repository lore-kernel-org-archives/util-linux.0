Aren't we already there?  My laptop, Fedora 29 with everything pretty much
default:

$  findmnt -n -oFSTYPE|sort|uniq -c
      1 autofs
      1 bpf
     11 cgroup
      1 cgroup2
      1 configfs
      1 debugfs
      1 devpts
      1 devtmpfs
      3 ext4
      1 fusectl
      1 fuse.gvfsd-fuse
      1 hugetlbfs
      1 mqueue
      1 proc
      1 pstore
      1 rpc_pipefs
      1 securityfs
      1 selinuxfs
      1 sysfs
      5 tmpfs

For what it's worth, the nfsd filesystem predated sysfs, just barely.

Looking at the history....  It was actually Al that introduced it in March
2002.  Patrick Mochel added sysfs in October 2002.

But it's true that from the start nfsd didn't really fit the model of a single
(possibly writeable) attribute per file.

(Might be interesting to look at the distribution of new filesystem types over
time, there may have been a peak around then.)

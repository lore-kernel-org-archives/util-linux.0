Ok, yeah.  My thought this afternoon was that the point of the CVE was
that an unprivileged user, in the absence of any admin-provided
/etc/sub{u,g}id or new{u,g}idmap at all, and who was being denied a file
access through one of his aux groups, could use a user namespace to drop
the aux group and access the file.  That if an admin went to the trouble
to grant subuid and subgids then it wasn't an issue.  But of course
allocations are being done automatically now so that's not a valid
point.

So let's proceed with the patch :)

A PR using nosetgroups against git://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow would
be great.

Well, we have many situations (another than mount -a) when you want to
know if the FS is mounted, but you have not permissions for mount(2)
or you don't want to try it (because mount(2) may trigger many another
things in userspace).

The problem is that the way between fstab entry and mount(2) is
sometimes pretty complex (mount.<type> helpers, loop devices,
UUID/LABEL translation, etc).

So, compare fstab with /proc/mounts is usually good compromise...

Your suggestion seems usable for mount -a, but it's one small use-case
(and for example systemd don't use "mount -a" during boot).

We have kill(PID, 0) to detect if the PID is valid, you don't have to
parse all /proc. It would be nice to have the same for filesystems,
something like

    mount("/dev/sda1, "/mnt", "ext4", MS_NOMOUNT, NULL)

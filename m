Fedora for example does not use /etc/mtab anymore.

man mount:

   The  remount  functionality follows the standard way how the mount
   command works with options from fstab. It means the mount command
   doesn't read fstab (or mtab) only when  a  device  and dir are fully
   specified.

         mount -o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir

   After this call all old mount options are replaced and arbitrary stuff
   from fstab is ignored, except the loop= option which is internally
   generated and maintained by the mount command.

         mount -o remount,rw  /dir

   After this call mount reads fstab (or mtab) and merges these options
   with options  from command line ( -o ).



Note that mtab is a fallback solution when the mountpoint is not found
in fstab, the mtab is not read by default.

Anyway, libmount allows to specify how use the mount options from mtab
and fstab. My plan is to add to mount(8) new command line options to
override the current default, probably something like:

  --options-mode={ignore,append,prepend,replace}
  --options-source={fstab,mtab,none}

so you will have a full control on options for mount(2) syscall.

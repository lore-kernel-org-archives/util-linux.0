Yeah, and all tools which read /etc/fstab with the glibc interface, to
find out the properties for the mount point, are just broken now. And
for what gain. Put a script in you RPM that merges your snippets into
the one fstab, and you get the same behaviour without any breakage.

Always remember, /etc/fstab is ABI, not a private config file, you
need a _very_ good reason to break it.

And you usually have not much problems convincing me that breakage is
justified. I just totally fail to see the benefit vs. gain in this
case.

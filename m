There is a man page for the nfsd filesystem, nfsd(7).  I should write up
something to add to that.  If people write code without reading that
then we may still end up boxed in, of course, but it's a start.

What I'm hoping we can count on from readers:

	- they will ignore any unkown files in clients/#/.
	- readers will ignore any lines in clients/#/info starting with
	  an unrecognized keyword.
	- they will ignore any unknown data at the end of
	  clients/#/opens.

That's in approximate decreasing order of my confidence in those rules
being observed, though I don't think any of those are too much to ask.

We could.  It won't be 100% reliable, of course (unlinks, renames), but
it could still be convenient for human readers, and an optimization for
non-human readers trying to find an inode.

The filehandle might be a good idea too.

I wonder if there's any issue with line length, or with quantity of data
emitted by a single seq_file show method.  The open owner can be up to
4K (after escaping), paths and filehandles can be long too.

In that case, I think so, as I don't know how committed wireshark is to
the choice of hash.

OK, good, I'm working on that.  Looks like fault injection gives up if
there are rpc's in process for the given client, whereas here I'd rather
force the expiry.  Looks like that needs some straightforward waitqueue
logic to wait for the in-progress rpc's.

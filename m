I heard about that it matters for RAID but since I don't really know
about RAID so I can't comment.

I do wonder whether the scsi disk driver should derive minimum/optimal
i/o size from VPD at all then. It might still be "tolerable" if it's
the limit of WRITE SAME(10), but definitely not if it's that of WRITE
SAME (16):

[tom@localhost ~]$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdc

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.26.2).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Device does not contain a recognized partition table.
Created a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0xccb261a9.

Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/sdc: 29.2 GiB, 31376707072 bytes, 61282631 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 4294966784 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0xccb261a9

Command (m for help): n
Partition type
   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)
Select (default p):

Using default response p.
Partition number (1-4, default 1):
First sector (8388607-61282630, default 8388607):
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (8388607-61282630, default 61282630):

Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 25.2 GiB.

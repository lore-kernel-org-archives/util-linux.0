yes. historically, storing the `size' == full device initialisation.
I believe, it used to be so since the beginning of zram. compression
algorithm selection was just plugged in into the existing scheme of
things.

you can't change compression algorithm on initialised/being used
device. obviously. if zram has X pages compressed with lz0 then
zram is supposed to use lz0 for decompression.

'streams' options is a little bit tricky. we have two different
implementations for a single and multi stream backends. and there are
reasons for that, to keep it short.

if you create device with a single stream backend -- you can't change
it any more.
if you create device with a multi stream backend -- you can change the
number of streams (though, it doesn't make a lot of sense to set streams
to 1 in that case).

iow, you can downgrade from multi stream to a multi stream device with
only 1 stream (which is not identical to a single stream), but you can't
upgrade a single stream device to a multi stream device.

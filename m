 Yes, maybe we can somehow improve the file format and the algorithm,
 suggestions?

 But we don't have mtab file in RHEL7 anymore, so we have to store the
 userspace specific mount options somewhere... (/run/mount/utab).  The
 solution is to minimize number of information we have to maintain in
 userspace.

 Unfortunately it seems that for example on my system we duplicate the
 information:

      utab:  retrans=20,addr=192.168.111.1

 mountinfo:  rw,vers=3,rsize=131072,wsize=131072,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,
             retrans=20,sec=sys,mountaddr=192.168.111.1,mountvers=3,mountport=39755,
             mountproto=udp,local_lock=none,addr=192.168.111.1

 (see retrans= and addr=)

 Maybe we can detect this situation and don't store duplicate options
 in userspace. The question is what happen with retrans= and addr=
 after remount. If I good remember there was any reason to maintain
 these stuff in userspace. Chuck?

 I guess nfs umount needs the addr= info.

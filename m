Hm.  I *think* that those SYS_262's are the newfstatat's.  And it looks
like they happen as part of the implementation of blkid_devno_to_devname
(just because you see that call start above the SYS_262's and return
only after).

That is indeed called from utils/mountd/cache.c:get_uuid_blkdev().

So libblkid is mapping device numbers to paths by stat'ing lots of stuff
under /dev.

I'm not sure what to do about that.... Cc'ing util-linux in case they
can help.
